# TWN

A Traveller and Stars without Number world generator.

## About

Stars without Number and Traveller both have world creation processes.  Each generating a different and somewhat overlapping overview of a system.

The goal of TWN is to use both processes to generate an even more descriptive world.

I envision that you should be able to feed in an already existing Stars without Number system and output the remaining Traveller attributes.  Those generated Traveller attributes would be informed by the Stars without Number attributes.  In other words, if you gave a Stars without Number system that has a Tech Level of 4, then the Traveller attributes that feed into Tech Level would need to be able to create the conditions so you could get that Tech Level.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:
